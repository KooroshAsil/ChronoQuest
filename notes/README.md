# Notes — ChronoQuest / notes

This folder stores short, approachable notes on time series concepts. Each file is designed to give you an intuitive explanation, a few key formulas, and quick examples you can copy into a notebook.

Files:
- overview.md — a gentle tour of main concepts (AR, MA, ARMA, stationarity, ACF/PACF, differencing).  
- stationary_processes/ — deeper reads and micro-examples on stationarity and related tests.

Use these notes as a quick refresher before diving into projects.
