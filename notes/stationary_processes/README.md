# Stationary Processes — Notes

This subfolder explores stationarity in more detail:
- What stationarity means (weak vs strong).
- Why stationarity matters for inference and forecasting.
- How to test for stationarity (ADF, KPSS: short intuition).
- Small examples (AR(1) with |phi|<1 vs |phi|>=1) and what they look like in time and ACF.

Each note mixes intuition, a short formula, and a tiny example you can run in a notebook.
